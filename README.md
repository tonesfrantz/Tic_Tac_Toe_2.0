# Tic_Tac_Toe_2.0

## JavaScript Version

Build game in the DOM. (as opposed to HTML)

**What do I need?**

-   Ability to store input of players.
-   Check for win without 16 loops
-   Winning logic
-   Switch player logic
-   Reset
-   Keep score over multiple games (Browser Memory)
-   Click event
-   Register which value was clicked
-   Store value
-   Check stored values for a win or not

**Steps:**

1. How to store input from players? Array, Object?
    - Answer:
        - I cam up with an Idea which I will elaborate on but after googling solutions there is a better way.
        - I will complete this option and then make another version with the next option
2. render funtion() to read stored input and validate win or not. Make this have the bility to do 4*4 or 5*5 games
3. Once above 2 steps complete, create player turn funciton
4. Store win over multiple games
5. Build DOM game and assign values to interface to interact with logic. This will be where buttons and event listeners will be creaated to assign values previously tested.

**Solutions**
H.W. for solutions

-   Given an array of any size , check that the values are all the same.
-   Given an array/object of any size (9,16 perfect square etc) how do we split the array/array into smaller arrays to check for winner
-

JEST Unit testing.

-   Remind yourself about 2D arrays

// .env and backend for hiding keys (npm dotenv) - need a proxy server(express can run within node) Would have to set up express APP which servs you html and CSS - local host 3000. (Review Project 3 from the course) - Server/WebApp/Server/Client/Folder.
