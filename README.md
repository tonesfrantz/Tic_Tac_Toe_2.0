-   Winning logic
-   Switch player logic
-   Reset
-   Keep score over multiple games (Browser Memory)
-   Click event
-   Register which value was clicked
-   Store value
-   Check stored values for a win or not

**Steps:**

1. How to store input from players? Array, Object?
    - Answer:
        - I cam up with an Idea which I will elaborate on but after googling solutions there is a better way.
        - I will complete this option and then make another version with the next option
2. render funtion() to read stored input and validate win or not. Make this have the bility to do 4*4 or 5*5 games
3. Once above 2 steps complete, create player turn funciton
4. Store win over multiple games
5. Build DOM game and assign values to interface to interact with logic. This will be where buttons and event listeners will be creaated to assign values previously tested.
